what threat modeling?
threat modeling is like a alert system finding risks early and provides security supports to business goals, no block them.

Main questions:
1) What are we working on?

2)What can go wrong?

3)What are we going to do about it?

4)Did we do a good enough job?

My idea: I think for small companies it is easier, to keep track and understand the risks.

##  Darknet Diaries - Game King exploit(Ep 8: Jackpot)

* two gamblers discovered a software bug in a poker Game video machine.

* The bug allowed them to change bet size after a winning hand and get much larger payouts.

*The exploit only worked when the “Double Up” feature was enabled.

*They could repeat payouts and make thousands of dollars per jackpot.

*They traveled to different casinos to avoid suspicion.

*Andre made about $480,000, John made over $500,000.

*Casinos noticed unusual winnings and reported it.

*Gaming Control Board and IGT confirmed the bug existed for years on many machines.

*Both were arrested and charged under computer fraud laws.

*Case was dropped later; no clear crime since they only used machine buttons.

*Andre lost the money and still owed taxes.
