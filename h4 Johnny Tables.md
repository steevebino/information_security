##  x) Read and Summarize

- Broken Access Control
  Broken Access Control is currently ranked as the #1 security risk in the OWASP Top 10.
   It occurs when an application fails to properly enforce "sandboxes," allowing users to act outside of their intended permissions.

  -Security Misconfiguration
  Security Misconfiguration is currently ranked as the #5 risk in the OWASP Top 10.
  It occurs when security settings are defined, implemented, or maintained improperly, often leaving "open doors" even if the application code itself is secure.

  -Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  Vulnerable and Outdated Components is currently the #6 risk in the OWASP Top 10.
  It focuses on the dangers of using third-party libraries, frameworks, or operating systems that have known security holes.

  -Injection
  njection is currently the #3 risk in the OWASP Top 10. While it has dropped from its long-held #1 spot, it remains one of the most dangerous
  vulnerabilities because it allows attackers to "trick" your application into executing unintended commands. Injection happens when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter
   (SQL, Bash, NoSQL, LDAP) as part of a command or query. The interpreter can't tell the difference between the developer's command and the attacker's data, so it executes both.
