Objective of article ----
The white paper presents a new model for computer network defense focused on intelligence-driven approaches 
rather than traditional vulnerability-centric methods.It was motivated by the rise of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

Limitations of traditional----
Conventional cybersecurity methods mainly focus on patching vulnerabilities and reacting after a breach occurs (incident response).
This reactive approach assumes defenders can fix flaws faster than attackers can exploit them.

Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense (CND)---
The paper advocates a proactive, threat-informed defense strategy. Instead of just finding and fixing vulnerabilities, defenders must understand:

*Who the adversary is

*Their intent and capabilities

*Their patterns of operation and tactics

Intrusion Kill Chain Framework---
A major contribution is the introduction of the Intrusion Kill Chain — 
an analytical model adapted from military targeting doctrine for cyber defense.

Key takeaways---
Traditional cyber defenses focused on vulnerabilities and post–compromise response are not sufficient against advanced threats.

The kill chain model gives defenders a framework to understand, analyze, and take action attacks.

Intelligence-driven defense allows organizations to turn attacker persistence into a defensive advantage.

a)  MITRE ATT&CK---

*A tactic is the adversary’s goal or objective, the 'why' behind an action describes what the attacker is trying to achieve.
ex: initial access, persistence, command or control, etc.

*A technique is the “how” the hacker attacked, describes the method used to access credentials.
ex: Credentials dumping: A method used to obtain credentials from a system in order to achieve the Credential Access tactic.

*A sub-technique is a more specific variation of a technique.
It describes a narrower or more precise way the technique can be carried out
ex:Dumping credentials from a specific system security component.

*A procedure is the real-world implementation of a technique or sub-technique.
It represents exactly how an attacker carried it out in an observed 
incident — including tools, scripts, or commands (documented by defenders for detection and analysis).
Ex: An attacker used a scripting environment already present on a system to extract authentication data from a running process during a breach investigation.
