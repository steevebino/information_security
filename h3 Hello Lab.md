**Install Debian on VirtualBox
I couldn't use the virtual box, because of my operating system, I have snapdragon, which recently came to market. So, I tried downnloading ubuntu, debian, both virtualbox(arm & amd version) mine is arm-based system in a windows, terchnical both doesn't work for some reason, I did some reseach and found out they have a beta version of virtualbox, but I couldn't find it lol. so, I am still waiting of the actual version to publish in their website.
I used WSL with debian app from microsoft store, it's basically a toy version of the actual linux server, where you could text out commands and check out what you want to do in a safe environment for beginnners who just started using, afraid to try in linux.
anyways you can use if you have my same situation. it's a great tool to play around.
